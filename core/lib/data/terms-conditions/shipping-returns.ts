Most of our electric scooters and bikes are shipped through UPS or Fedex ground services and delivery times range from 2 days in California to 4-5 days on the east coast but may vary greatly with delays. Call for a more definitive delivery estimation. We do offer express delivery through UPS, Fedex and USPS.
